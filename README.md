# Would You Rather...?

This application allows you to ask users a 'Would You Rather' question, providing a choice between 2 options.  You can answer any question that has been submitted, including your own.  You can only answer a question once and can not change your selection.

Clicking on a question you have answered will show the number of times a response was chosen and a percentage.  The selection you made will be highlighted.

A leaderboard is provided tracking the number of questions asked and answered by each user.  Rankings are in descending order.


To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Note:
I wanted to try using a React css framework.  I decided to use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) so you'll see that in my code.
